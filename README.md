# üè° Airbnb Clone Project

## üìò Project Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb. The goal is to simulate a real-world development environment, focusing on backend architecture, database design, API security, and CI/CD integration.

This project emphasizes **team collaboration**, **clean architecture**, and **scalable design**. By the end of the project, the team will have built a fully functional backend system capable of handling bookings, property listings, and user management ‚Äî while adhering to modern software engineering standards.

## üéØ Project Goals
- Develop a scalable web application that mirrors Airbnb‚Äôs key features.
- Strengthen backend development skills using Django and GraphQL.
- Understand and implement secure APIs and CI/CD pipelines.
- Design an efficient relational database using MySQL.
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub and professional development workflows.

## üß∞ Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **Django** | A Python web framework for building the backend and REST APIs efficiently. Handles routing, ORM, and server logic. |
| **MySQL** | Relational database used to store structured data such as users, properties, and bookings. |
| **GraphQL** | Provides a flexible and efficient query system for fetching and mutating data. Enables frontend clients to request exactly what they need. |
| **Docker** | Containerizes the app for consistent development and deployment environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automates testing, linting, and deployment using CI/CD pipelines. |
| **Nginx / Gunicorn (optional)** | Used for serving the application in a production environment. |
| **Redis (optional)** | Provides caching and session management for faster responses. |

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### **Key Entities**
1. **User**
   - `id`: Unique user identifier  
   - `name`: Full name of the user  
   - `email`: Unique email for login  
   - `password_hash`: Encrypted password  
   - `role`: Defines if user is host or guest  

2. **Property**
   - `id`: Property ID  
   - `owner_id`: References User  
   - `title`: Property name  
   - `location`: City or address  
   - `price_per_night`: Cost per night  

3. **Booking**
   - `id`: Booking ID  
   - `user_id`: References User (guest)  
   - `property_id`: References Property  
   - `check_in`: Date of arrival  
   - `check_out`: Date of departure  

4. **Review**
   - `id`: Review ID  
   - `user_id`: References User  
   - `property_id`: References Property  
   - `rating`: Integer (1‚Äì5)  
   - `comment`: Review text  

5. **Payment**
   - `id`: Payment ID  
   - `booking_id`: References Booking  
   - `amount`: Total cost  
   - `status`: (pending, completed, failed)  
   - `payment_method`: e.g. card, PayPal  

### **Relationships**
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.  
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.  
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.  
- Each **Booking** is associated with a **Payment**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Breakdown

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **User Management** | Handles user registration, login, and authentication. Supports host and guest roles. |
| **Property Management** | Allows hosts to list, update, and delete properties with pricing and availability. |
| **Booking System** | Enables guests to search, view, and book available properties. Prevents double bookings. |
| **Review System** | Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties after completed stays. |
| **Payment Integration** | Handles secure payment processing and confirmation using APIs or mock gateways. |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Provides administrative access for managing users, properties, and reports. |

## üîí API Security

### **Key Measures**
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use JWT for user sessions and API access control.  
   - Protect endpoints based on user roles (guest/host/admin).  

2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks through proper validation and Django‚Äôs built-in protections.  

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Control API call frequency to prevent abuse or DDoS attacks.  

4. **Secure Data Handling**
   - Encrypt passwords and sensitive information (e.g., payment data).  
   - Use HTTPS in production for encrypted traffic.  

5. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Store secrets (DB credentials, JWT keys) in `.env` files and never commit them to GitHub.  

### **Why Security Matters**
Security ensures user trust and protects personal data, financial transactions, and the overall reliability of the application. Breaches can damage both the project‚Äôs integrity and user safety.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### **What is CI/CD?**
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** ‚Äî a process that automates code testing, building, and deployment whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

### **Pipeline Overview**
1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
   - Every push triggers automated tests and lint checks.
   - Ensures code quality before merging to main branch.

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
   - Automatically builds Docker images and deploys to the chosen environment (e.g., Render, AWS, or Docker Hub).

### **Tools Used**
- **GitHub Actions:** For running CI/CD workflows automatically.
- **Docker:** For containerization and environment consistency.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS EC2 (optional):** For deployment targets.
